Hi! I am Tianyi Xiong, a Ph.D. student at University of Maryland, College Park working with [Heng Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4OqLaDwAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests are machine learning and computer vision, especially exploring the emerging capacity of vision foundation models and multi-modality.

Previously, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics at Tsinghua University, where I was fortunate to work with [Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/) (at UCSD remotely),  [Songhai Zhang](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1214/4073.htm) and [Shimin Hu](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/shimin.htm). I also interned at MSRA with [Steve Lin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/stevelin/) and [Zhirong Wu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/wuzhiron/).

<!-- <b>Research Interest:</b> machine learning, computer vision and multi-modality. -->
<!-- I am especially interested in adapting vision models into the open world with the general knowledge learnt jointly from other modalities.  -->
