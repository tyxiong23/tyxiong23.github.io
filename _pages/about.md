Hi! I am Tianyi, a senior undergraduate student majoring in [<b><font color="purple">Computer Science</font></b>](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/)  and minoring in Statistics at [<b><font color="purple">Tsinghua University</font></b>](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). My research interests cover machine learning and computer vision.  I am especially interested in adapting vision models into the open world with the general knowledge learnt from other modalities (e.g. natural language). Currently I am a remote research intern at mlPC Lab, University of California San Diego with Prof. [Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/).

I graduated from <b>Beijing No.4 High School </b>in 2019. As a member of Beijing Team, I attended the <b>$35^{th}$ CPhO Final </b>in Shanghai and won a silver medal.

Outside research and studying, I am a huge fan of soccer, track&field and Formula 1. I spent two wonderful years in Tsinghua Amateur Soccer Team as the key right-back, winning the <b>2020 Beijing University Soccer Championship</b> with my amazing coach and teammates. I was also a member of Tsinghua Amateur Long-distance Race Team.
