Hi! I am Tianyi, a senior undergraduate student majoring in [<b><font color="purple">Computer Science</font></b>](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/)  and minoring in Statistics at [<b><font color="purple">Tsinghua University</font></b>](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). My research interests cover machine learning, computer vision and multimodality.

I graduated from [<b><font color="blue">Beijing No.4 High School in 2019</font></b>](http://bhsf.lezhiyun.com/cms/). As a member of Beijing Team, I attended the $35^{th}$ CPhO Final in Shanghai and won a silver medal.

Outside research and studying, I am a huge fan of soccer, track&field and Formula 1. I spent two wonderful years in Tsinghua Amateur Soccer Team as the key right-back, winning the <b>2020 Beijing University Soccer Championship</b> with my amazing coach and teammates. I was also a member of Tsinghua Amateur Long-distance Race Team.
