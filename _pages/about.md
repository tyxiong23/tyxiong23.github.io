Hi! I am Tianyi, a senior undergraduate student majoring in [<b><font color="purple">Computer Science</font></b>](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/)  and minoring in Statistics at [<b><font color="purple">Tsinghua University</font></b>](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). My research interests cover machine learning, computer vision and multi-modality.  I am especially interested in adapting vision models into the open world with the general knowledge learnt jointly from other modalities (e.g. natural language). Currently I am a remote research intern at mlPC Lab, University of California San Diego with Prof. [Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/). Previously, I interned at [The Graphics and Geometric Computing Group, Tsinghua University](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) under the guidance of [Prof. Songhai Zhang](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1214/4073.htm) and [Prof. Shimin Hu](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/shimin.htm).

I graduated from <b>Beijing No.4 High School </b>in 2019. As a member of Beijing Team, I attended the <b>$35^{th}$ CPhO Final </b>in Shanghai and won a silver medal.

<b>I am looking for a PhD position starting from Fall 2023.</b>
