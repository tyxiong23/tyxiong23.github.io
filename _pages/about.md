Hi! I am Tianyi Xiong, a first-year Ph.D. student at University of Maryland, College Park working with Prof. [Heng Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4OqLaDwAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate study, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/) (at UCSD remotely), Prof. [Songhai Zhang](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1214/4073.htm) and Prof. [Shimin Hu](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/shimin.htm). I was also a research intern at MSRA with [Steve Lin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/stevelin/) and [Zhirong Wu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/wuzhiron/).
