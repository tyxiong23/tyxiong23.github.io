Outside research and studying, I am a huge fan of sports, especially soccer, track & field and Formula One. I also enjoy a variety of hobbies, including playing the piano, volunteering, and being a vlogger. **Subscribe me on [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/26738853)!**

Sports in Tsinghua
======

I spent two wonderful years in Tsinghua Amateur Soccer Team as the key right-back, winning the <b>2020 Beijing University Soccer Championship</b> with my amazing coach and teammates. We also won the 2nd place of Beijing in 2021.

I was also a member of **Tsinghua Amateur Long-distance Race Team**. I won the bronze medal of mens 4x100m relay and the bronze medal of mixed 4x400m relay in 13th Autumn Sports Meeting of Beijing Universities.

Department of Computer Science and Technology (also nicknamed <b><font color="red">"酒井"</font></b>) has a good sports atmosphere. As a member of the  <b><font color="red">"酒井"</font></b> team and the captain of our department's running team, I enjoy playing sports and winning with my teammates in the annual <b>John Ma Cup of Tsinghua University</b>. I sincerely hope that we can stay healthy and contribute to our home country for more than 50 years (<b><font color="purple">为祖国健康工作五十年<b></font>)!

Volunteering
======
Since I was in primary school, I has been volunteering for more than 580 hours. During high school, I served as a volunteer tour guide at the beautiful [Former Residence of Soong Ching-ling](http://www.sql.org.cn/). I was privileged to be a doping control chaperone at Yanqing Sliding Center for Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. Here are some photos!
