Outside research and studying, I am a huge fan of sports. 

Sports in Tsinghua
======

I spent two wonderful years in Tsinghua Amateur Soccer Team as the key right-back, winning the <b>2020 Beijing University Soccer Championship</b> with my amazing coach and teammates. We also won the 2nd place of Beijing in 2021.

I was also a member of **Tsinghua Amateur Long-distance Race Team**. I won the bronze medal of mens 4x100m relay and the bronze medal of mixed 4x400m relay in 13th Autumn Sports Meeting of Beijing Universities.
