## Machine Learning, Perception, and Cognition Lab, <i>University of California, San Diego</i> &emsp; &emsp; <small>07/2022--11/2022</small>
**Advisor: Prof. Zhuowen Tu**
- ### Open-Vocabulary Image Segmentation
  - Proposed a universal two-stage framework for panoptic, instance and semantic segmentation.
  - Focused on adapting CLIP's feature space for fine-grained segmentation, and found out an efficient and effective way of finetuning the query projections of CLIP's visual branch.
  - Outperformed previous works on all three tasks by at least 25%. **Co-first authored a paper to appear in ICCV 2023**.


## Graphics and Geometric Computing Group, <i>Tsinghua University</i> &emsp; &emsp; <small>04/2021--07/2022</small>
**Advisor: Prof. Shimin Hu and Prof. Songhai Zhang**
- ### Write A Video: Automatic Video Editing System
  - Proposed a three-step to generate well-edited short movies from input videos, simplified user input into text descriptions and choice making.
  - Utilized CLIP for multi-label theme mapping and video clustering.
- ### Automatic Commercial Place Planning System
  - Parameterized design plans for commercial places into a set of patterns and constraints, and designed an optimization algorithm based on simulation annealing.
  - Reached comparable results with professional designers in terms of scene plausibility and shopping efficiency in user study. Contributed to a paper **submitted to IEEE VR 2023**.
- ### Semi-superivised Image Cropping
  - Applied GANs for cropping images into aesthetically composed sub-images. Solved model collapse by adding saliency detection as features of image structure and designing special loss based on prior knowledge of photography.
